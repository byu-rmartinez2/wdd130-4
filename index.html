        <p>Hello, my name is Rene Martinez, from the beautiful country of Philippines. I am an aspiring web developer
            with a passion for creativity and technology. I love capturing life's beautiful moments through photography
            and videography, which fuels my eye for design and detail. Currently, I am studying Web Fundamentals at BYU
            Pathway, where I am building the essential skills to create modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites.
            I am genuinely excited to learn deeper about web development and bring ideas to life through building
            websites. Becoming a skilled Web Developer is my dream career, and I am committed to learning, growing, and
            contributing to the digital world. Thank you very much!
